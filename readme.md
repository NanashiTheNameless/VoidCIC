# VoidCIC

## VoidCIC is a fork of the original [NullCIC](<https://github.com/Redherring32/NullCIC/>)

A little board to replace the CIC on the Original NES or [OpenTendo](<https://github.com/Redherring32/OpenTendo>), and restore reset functionality.

All the files needed to make your own are located in the [Production folder](<production>).

It is also for sale on my [Tindie](<https://www.tindie.com/products/37068/>) for those who dont wanna make it themselves, or those who want to support me!

[![I sell on Tindie](https://d2ss6ovg47m0r5.cloudfront.net/badges/tindie-larges.png)](https://www.tindie.com/stores/namelessnanashi/?ref=offsite_badges&utm_source=sellers_NamelessNanashi&utm_medium=badges&utm_campaign=badge_large)

You can also do the same thing that NullCIC/VoidCIC does manually, just check ["Reset fix without NullCIC(VoidCIC).jpg"](<Reset fix without NullCIC(VoidCIC).jpg>) for instructions!
