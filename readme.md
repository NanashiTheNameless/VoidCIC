# VoidCIC

## VoidCIC is a fork of the original [NullCIC](<https://github.com/Redherring32/NullCIC/>)

A little board to replace the CIC on the original NES or [OpenTendo](<https://github.com/Redherring32/OpenTendo>), and restore reset functionality.

All the files needed to make your own are located in the [Production folder](<production>).

You can also do the same thing that NullCIC/VoidCIC does manually, just check ["Reset fix without NullCIC(VoidCIC).jpg"](<Reset fix without NullCIC(VoidCIC).jpg>) for instructions!
